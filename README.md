### Simple helps Channels Discord Bot
This Bot allows users to use the very recently popular framework of having "help channels"
that can be used on discord servers to ask questions. The layout is quite simplistic and allows for expansion.
This version of the bot does the absolute minimum to ensure smooth service.



## How to run the bot
So far the bot hasn't been fully built to be set up through the text channels on discord.
It does take a fair bit of setting up and some basic faimliarity with how python discords are
made.

** I wil expand on this in the future as this is still work in progress **
